# Flutter Authentication Design

This is a simple authentication design for a Flutter project that includes a welcome page, a login page, and a sign-up page. This project is designed for beginners who are just getting started with Flutter and want to implement basic authentication functionality.

## Getting Started

Make sure you have Flutter installed on your machine. If not, you can follow the installation instructions on the [official Flutter website](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/flutter-authentication-design.git
cd flutter-authentication-design
```

### Install Dependencies

```

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- **lib/**
  - **screens/**
    - **welcome_screen.dart**: The welcome page.
    - **login_screen.dart**: The login page.
    - **signup_screen.dart**: The sign-up page.
  - **main.dart**: The entry point of the application.

## Run the Application

flutter run
```

This will launch the app on your connected device or emulator.

## Features
